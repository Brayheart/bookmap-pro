## BookMap
#### Version 1.234 Beta

*Highly recommended you set up hotkeys before using.*

Open the console and begin typing a folder name. When your target folder is selected press tab or enter to add a bookmark to it.

There are also 4 hot-keys (the maximum allowed by chrome extensions) that you can assign to folders for instant book mark creation.
